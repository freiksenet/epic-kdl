       "The Codex Astartes is the holy tome of these loyal Battle Brothers. The wisdom of the ancients is both scripture and the unbending rod by which they are measured. In war, they are fierce and as steadfast as those of old who stood beside the Emperor and broke the Legions of Horus. In faith and valour they are unmatched. The torches of their chapels burn bright with flames whose holy fire has shone upon an unchanging brotherhood for a hundred centuries. In their lives and in war, the Codex Astartes is their guide."
